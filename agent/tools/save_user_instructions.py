    """Save the triggering user's standing, user-level custom instructions.

    Call this only when the user states a standing behavioural preference
    ("always …", "never …", "from now on …", "stop doing …") that should apply
    to all their future runs — not for one-off task details.

    This is a full replacement: pass the COMPLETE new instruction text. Your
    current user-level instructions are shown in your system prompt under "Your
    Custom Instructions (user-level)"; preserve those lines and add the new rule
    unless the user asked you to change or remove something. Pass an empty string
    only when the user asks to clear their instructions.

    Changes take effect from the next run onward, and the user can edit them in
    the dashboard Profile tab.

    Args:
        instructions: The complete user-level instruction text (markdown).

    Returns:
        ``{"ok": True, "login": str, "instructions": str}`` on success, or
        ``{"ok": False, "error": str}`` when the user could not be resolved.
